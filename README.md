# Mario Kart 64 - NEAT Algorithm

This is an implementation of the NEAT algorithm in Lua for Mario Kart 64 and the BizHawk emulator. To use this code you need to create a save state at the beginning of a level. The code expects the name of the save state file to be BB150.state, however you can change this by changing line 54 of the code (state_file = "BB150.state"). Make sure the save state file is in the Lua folder (in the BizHawk folder) in order to use it.
